            <p>At CEW+, we work to break down barriers and increase access through funding. For U-M students, staff, faculty, and surrounding community, we offer opportunities for scholarships, emergency grants, sponsorships, fellowships, and more for a range of situations and life circumstances.</p>

                <h3>Scholarships for U-M Students</h3>
                <p>The CEW+ Scholarship Program was established in 1970 to honor the academic performance and potential of women whose education has been interrupted and to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of the admission of women to the University of Michigan.  Thanks to the generosity of individuals, organizations, clubs, and foundations, CEW+ has awarded over 1,900 scholarships since 1970. With support from our generous donors, CEW+ was able to expand the program in 2008 to include additional scholarships for students of all genders.</p>
